This error occurs when using a component that expects a specific prop type but receives a different one. For example, if a component expects a number prop but receives a string, this error will be thrown. This is a common error in React Native due to the dynamic nature of data handling. 

Example:

```javascript
// Incorrect prop type
<MyComponent someProp="10" /> 

// Correct prop type
<MyComponent someProp={10} />
```
